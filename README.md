# The JavaScript Minesweeper Story

It's pretty straight forward: I needed a vehicle to get my hands dirty playing with gfx rendering with HTML5. 
So we used canvas graphics to make the images. No PNG or GIf or JPG anywhere.  No special CSS or HTML for game 
board layout and no using table elements either. (see JavaScript Sudoku for that lesson)

Also as a side interest I wanted to explore how this would work on touch enabled mobile devices.  So we tried 
to make this as touch friendly as possible.  This meant changing the game slightly and removing the flags and 
question mark tools that help you sweep the mine field.  

In the end we made a retro looking simplified casual game.

I hope you enjoy it.
